# Final


Summary of project goals:
  My project goals were pretty simple. I already had the base of making the turn based combat game. I just needed to add a few different things. Player interaction, ability to use skills and heal, skill cooldown, different classes, random enemies. 
Instructions:
  Choose one of the characters. You will be put up against one of four enemies. Attack attacks the enemy. Skill uses the unique class skill. Heal heals you. Do your best to beat the enemy.
Technolgoies and techniques:
  I used a lot of class and def functions. I broke everything down into functions and went from there.
Description of process:
  What did I learn?
    I learned how to use def and class functions a lot better. 
  Where did I get stuck?
    I got stuck in making the skill cooldown. It took me a while to figure it out. 
  What would I like to improve?
    I'd like to improve the program by adding graphics. It was in my stretch goals but I was not able to get to it.
  How would I do things differently next time?
    Give the project more time so I could potentially work on my stretch goals a lot more.
  How far did I stray for the game design document?
    I did not really stray from it at all. I had the basic idea of what I wanted to do and then I did it.
  How did I stay on track?
    I gave myself 4 days with a goal in each day and I would not stop working on it until I achieved that certain goal.
